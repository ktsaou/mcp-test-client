## [0.1.0-legacy] - 2026-04-23

The initial import — a working prototype extracted from the
[Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata) repository, with its Netdata
branding still visible in places. This version continues to live in the
`legacy/` directory and will be removed once the v1.0 rewrite ships.
